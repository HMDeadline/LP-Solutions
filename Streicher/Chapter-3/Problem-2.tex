(Page 26) (Theorem 3.3). Let $(A_i | i \in I)$ be a family of predomains. Then their product $\prod_{i \in I} A_i$ is a predomain
    under the componentwise ordering, and the prodjections $\pi_i : \prod_{i \in I} A_i \to A_i$ are Scott continuous. If, moreover, all $A_i$ are domains then so is their product $\prod_{i \in I} A_i$.
