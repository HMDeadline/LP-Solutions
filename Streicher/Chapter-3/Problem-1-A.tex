Let $ f:(A, \sqsubseteq_A) \to (B, \sqsubseteq_B) $ be a Scott continuous function between predomains. For any $x,y \in A$ with $ x \leq y $, we have that
    $ X = \{x,y\} $ is a directed subset of $A$. The supremum of the set $X$ is obviously $y$. Thus $\bigsqcup X = y$, and since $f$ is continuous, $f(\bigsqcup X) = f(y) = \bigsqcup f(\{x,y\})$.
    Hence, $f(x) \leq f(y)$.
